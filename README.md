This is a project I've been working on in my very spare time that's really just been for fun and educational purposes.

At the end of the day, it's really a renderer written in Vulkan that uses physically based techniques.

Currently, only Ubuntu is really supported. The practical value of this repository is really only to demonstrate code samples and nothing more until I have the time

to add polish.

The Vulkan implementation can be found in base/backend/vulkan.hpp.
